# Insemble-Terminal

## About
A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project boilerplate/template with lots of state of the art libraries and tools like:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), for building interactive UIs
- [django-js-reverse](https://github.com/ierror/django-js-reverse), for generating URLs on JS
- [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), for responsive styling
- [WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/) with [brotlipy](https://github.com/python-hyper/brotlipy), for efficient static files serving
- [prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) for automated quality assurance (does not replace proper testing!)

For continuous integration, a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) configuration `.circleci/config.yml` is included.

Also, includes a Heroku `app.json` and a working Django `production.py` settings, enabling easy deployments with ['Deploy to Heroku' button](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button). Those Heroku plugins are included in `app.json`:
- PostgreSQL, for DB
- Redis, for Celery
- Sendgrid, for e-mail sending
- Papertrail, for logs and platform errors alerts (must set them manually)

#### If you are using plain python:
- Create the migrations for `users` app: 
  `python manage.py makemigrations`
- Run the migrations:
  `python manage.py migrate`

#### If you are using Docker:
- Create the migrations for `users` app:  
  `docker-compose run --rm backend python manage.py makemigrations`
- Run the migrations:
  `docker-compose run --rm backend python manage.py migrate`

### Tools
- Setup [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/), [prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) and [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) in the text editor you will use to develop.

### Running the project (without docker)
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`
- Open another command line window.
- `workon insemble-terminal` or `source insemble-terminal/bin/activate` depending on if you are using virtualenvwrapper or just virtualenv.
- Go to the `backend` directory.
- `python manage.py runserver`


### Running the project (with docker)
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory.
- `docker-compose up -d `
To access the logs for each service run `docker-compose logs -f service_name` (either backend, frontend, etc)

#### Celery
- Open a command line window and go to the project's directory
- `workon insemble-terminal` or `source insemble-terminal/bin/activate` depending on if you are using virtualenvwrapper or just virtualenv.
- `python manage.py celery`

### Testing
`make test`

Will run django tests using `--keepdb` and `--parallel`. You may pass a path to the desired test module in the make command. E.g.:

`make test someapp.tests.test_views`
